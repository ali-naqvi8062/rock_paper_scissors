The widely known Rock, Paper, Scissors game! 

This was my very first use of the basics of javascript which I used to create the classic rock paper scissors game.

The project helped me grasp the basics of functions, loops and nested if-statements used in conjuction to create
a program with javascript. I also learned how to incorporate javascript into CSS and HTML to make a functioning webpage that is interactive. 

Various learning skills were applied to create the UI in conjunction with Javascript which include DOM manipulation and event handling.

Lastly, I gained more experience with git commands including branching and logging. 

In the future I look to learning how to make my webpage more aethetically pleasing and also learn about methods with which I can make the webpage mobile friendly.
