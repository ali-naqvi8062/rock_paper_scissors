# rock_paper_scissors
rock, paper, scissors game on console. 
My very first use of the basics of javascript used to create the classic rock paper scissors game within the console. 
This small project helped me grasp the basics of functions, loops and nested if-statements used in conjuction to create
a program. 
Additionally, I gained more experience with git commands on the command line which further refined my git knowledge.
In the future I look to learning how to make my webpage more interactive and transferring the game onto the web instead of
keeping it on the console.
